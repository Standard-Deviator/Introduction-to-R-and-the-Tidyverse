# Introduction-to-R-and-the-Tidyverse

Welcome to the Tidyverse,

1. Ensure that both R and RStudio have been installed on your computer.
2. Download and extract the course resources as a .zip file via the green "Clone or download" button.
    BE SURE TO EXTRACT THE FILES ONTO YOUR HARDDRIVE, OPENING A FILE FROM THE ZIP FOLDER WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS
3. Double-click the Introduction-to-R-and-the-Tidyverse.RProj file to launch RStudio
4. Install the "learnr" and the "tidyverse" packages (we will do this step together during the first class).

If you are using a lab computer, you only need to download the course resources.
If you are using a personal laptop, ensure that you have a updated version of R and RStudio installed.

Good luck, and I look forward to meeting you all tomorrow!
